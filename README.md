Malicious DNS Traffic Detection using Deep Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to identify and classify malicious DNS traffic using deep learning techniques. DNS traffic analysis is essential for detecting various types of network threats, such as malware communication, data exfiltration, and botnet activity. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, the system can automatically detect abnormal patterns in DNS traffic and classify them as benign or malicious.
